    Describe networking fundamental concepts.
    Explain Amazon VPC features, benefits, and use cases.
    Discuss how to configure public and private subnets.
    Discuss how to configure route tables to direct traffic in your network.

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies. Modern-day network solutions deliver more than connectivity. They are critical for the digital transformation and success of businesses today.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that you can use to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. This section (called a virtual private cloud, or VPC) is where you can launch your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. With Amazon VPC, you have control over your virtual networking resources. These resources include the selection of your own IP address range, the creation of subnets, and the configuration of route tables and network gateways.

In this course, you acquire the knowledge you that you need to start using Amazon VPC. You learn about the key elements of Amazon VPC and explore how to configure them. You learn how to set up security for VPCs and learn about other AWS networking services.
